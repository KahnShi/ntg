	* README: added instructions for how to get to compile under OS X.

	* src/matrix.c (SubFMatrix, DoubleFMatrix, DoubleMatrix): malloc ->
	calloc

	* src/ntg.c (ntg, NPfunobj): malloc -> calloc

	* src/matrix.c (FMatrixMult): fixed initialization error

	* examples/vanderpol.c (main): changed malloc to calloc throughout

	* src/constraints.h, src/constraints.c: moved malloc.h out of this
	constraints.h and into individual files

	* src/matrix.c (DoubleFMatrix): replaced malloc + memset with calloc

	* src/colloc.c: changed malloc to calloc throughout

	* src/colloc.c (CollocMult): fixed error in initialization;
	B->elements[j][i] was only being set for j = 0.  Didn't fix the
	problem with examples/vanderpol getting bad values

	* src/constraints.h: include <sys/malloc.h> instead of <malloc.h>

	* doc/Makefile: empty file to allow 'make clean' to work from main
	directory 

	* examples/Makefile, src/Makefile, pgs/Makefile, npsol/Makefile:
	fixed small errors and removed CC and F77 assignments (use system
	version or overwrite on the command line)

	* Changes: moved contents to ChangeLog

	* README: updated instructions to indicate that PGS files are
	automatically grabbed using wget
