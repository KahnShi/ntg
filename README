This directory contains the source code for the NTG software package.

Version:	2.2a
Release Date:	2 February 2002
Contact:	murray@cds.caltech.edu

INSTALLATION
------------
In order to install NTG, you will need to install two other software
packages that are licensed separately: NPSOL and PGS.

NPSOL is a numerical optimization library that uses sequential
quadratic programming to solve nonlinear optimization problems.  It is
not in the public domain, but licenses are available at low cost for
university and government usage.  More information on NPSOL is
available at

    http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/NPSOL.htm

PGS is the Practical Guide to Splines companion software.  It is in
the public domain and is included in the NTG distribution in the pgs/
subdirectory.  The latest version of the PGS software is available from

    http://www.netlib.org/pppack/

This version of NTG has been tested under linux (RH 7.2) and should
work in most vanilla unix environments.

To install NTG:
  1. Unpack ntg.tar into the directory of your choice
  2. Edit Makefile and make sure everything is pointed where you want
  3. Type 'make" to make all NTG libraries and programs
  4. If everything works, type 'make install' to install the library
     and programs

Example programs are available in the subdirectory 'examples/'.  These
programs should compile correctly after you have installed the
software.  You will need to edit the makefile to point to the properly
directories for the include files and libraries.  You will also need
to have the PGS and NPSOL package installed on your system.  See
pgs/README for directions on installing the version of PGS distributed
with NTG.

(Note for Caltech CDS users: Caltech has a site license for NPSOL.
You can get a copy of the source code from cds:~murray/src/npsol/.)
