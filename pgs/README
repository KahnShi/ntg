This directory contains the files needed to make PGS.  The source
code for PGS is not distributed with NTG, so you will need to obtain
that separately.  The sources files for PGS are available at

  http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/pgs/

INSTALLATION
------------
To install PGS, you must first get the original source code files
(see URL above).  The following files are required for NTG:

  banfac.f, banslv.f, bchfac.f, bchslv.f, bsplpp.f, bsplvb.f, bsplvd.f,
  bspp2d.f, bvalue.f, chol1d.f, colpnt.f, cubspl.f, difequ.f, eqblok.f,
  interv.f, knots.f, l2appr.f, l2err.f, l2knts.f, l2main.f, newnot.f,
  newnotfk.f, ppvalu.f, putit.f, round.f, setdatx2.f, setdatx3.f,
  setdatx4.f, setupq.f, smooth.f, spli2d.f, splint.f

Once these files are installed in the npsol/ directory, perform the
following steps to install NPSOL:

  1. Edit Makefile and make sure everything is pointed where you want
  2. Type 'make" to make the PGS library
  3. If everything works, type 'make install' to install the library

Local changes

30 Sept 1999, Mark Milam: 
  * There seemed to be problem with inconsistent array dimensions
    in the files bvalue.f l2appr.f l2err.f
  * Bad declarations
      + bvalue.f line 65 t declared with two different array sizes.
      + l2appr.f line 66 same as bvalue.f
      + l2err.f line 29 ftau and error declare with 2 different array sizes
    I commented out the declarations I though were mistakes and used
    the ones that made more sense
  * removed colloc.f from the library
