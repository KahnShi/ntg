This directory contains the files needed to make PGS.  The source
code for PGS is not distributed with NTG, so you will need to obtain
that separately.  The sources files for PGS are available at

  http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/pgs/

INSTALLATION
------------
To install PGS, you must first get the original source code files
(see URL above).  The following files are required for NTG:

  banfac.f, banslv.f, bchfac.f, bchslv.f, bsplpp.f, bsplvb.f, bsplvd.f,
  bspp2d.f, bvalue.f, chol1d.f, colpnt.f, cubspl.f, difequ.f, eqblok.f,
  interv.f, knots.f, l2appr.f, l2err.f, l2knts.f, l2main.f, newnot.f,
  newnotfk.f, ppvalu.f, putit.f, round.f, setdatx2.f, setdatx3.f,
  setdatx4.f, setupq.f, smooth.f, spli2d.f, splint.f

If you have wget on your system, the default makefile should install
the latest version of these files if they are not available.

Once these files are installed in the npsol/ directory, perform the
following steps to install NPSOL:

  1. Edit Makefile and make sure everything is pointed where you want
  2. Type 'make" to make the PGS library
  3. If everything works, type 'make install' to install the library

To test the installation, you can run 'make test', which will grab
additional source code and data files from the PGS web site, compile
everything and then run the tests.

If you don't have f77 on your machine, but instead have gfortran (more
modern) then you can use the command

  make F77=gfortran

Local changes

30 Sept 1999, Mark Milam: 
  * There seemed to be problem with inconsistent array dimensions
    in the files bvalue.f l2appr.f l2err.f
  * Bad declarations
      + bvalue.f line 65 t declared with two different array sizes.
      + l2appr.f line 66 same as bvalue.f
      + l2err.f line 29 ftau and error declare with 2 different array sizes
    I commented out the declarations I though were mistakes and used
    the ones that made more sense
  * removed colloc.f from the library
  * NOTE (RMM, 2 Jan 2013): not sure if this comment is still relevant

2 Jan 2013, Richard Murray:
  * For gfortran, need to edit l2err.f and l2main.f and change 'ON' to 1:

        data on /'ON'/    --->     data on /1/  

  * This probably breaks some options in PGS, but works OK for NTG
